# What is Bing Chat? Learn How to Use Bing Chat

Bing Chat is an AI chatbot experience from Microsoft based on the popular ChatGPT (version 4) Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI to offer similar responses to how humans will answer questions.

Bing Chat is different from the traditional search engine experience since it provides complete answers to questions instead of a bunch of links on a result page that may help you find the answer you are seeking.
